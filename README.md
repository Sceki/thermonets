# thermoNETS
This repository contains the code developed during the European Spage Agency's ACT study:

```Izzo,D. and Acciarini, G. and Biscani, F. "NeuralODEs for VLEO simulations: Introducing thermoNET for Thermosphere Modeling" - 29th International Symposium on Space Flight Dynamics (ISSFD), 22- 26 April 2024, Darmstadt, Germany. ```

# A sneak peak
Here is a glimpse of what our neural implicit representation of the thermospheric density looks like, compared to the ground truth .... pretty impressive right?
