## Info

This repository introduces a novel neural architecture termed thermoNET, designed to represent thermospheric density in satellite orbital propagation, using a reduced amount of differentiable computations.

Due to the appearance of a neural network on the right-hand side of the equations of motion, the resulting satellite dynamics is governed by a NeuralODE, a neural Ordinary Differential Equation, characterized by its fully differentiable nature, allowing the derivation of variational equations (hence of the state transition matrix) and facilitating its use in connection to advanced numerical techniques such as Taylor-based numerical propagation and differential algebraic techniques. Efficient training of the network parameters occurs through two distinct approaches.

This repository contains the code to train, analyze, and use thermoNETs for downstream tasks: including orbit propagation and neuralODE training. This was developed during the European Spage Agency's ACT study:

## Goals
https://github.com/esa/thermonets/assets/3327087/09267ff1-4939-49a6-b8fd-be0cb26f2a60

* represent thermospheric density empirical models via a lightweight neural network (only a few thousand parameters)
* neural ODE training to adjust trained architectures to match observed and/or simulated satellite data
* neural representation of NRLMSISE-00 and JB-08 (pre-trained) and available
* tutorial on the use of thermoNET for pure inference (i.e., as a thermospheric density model), during orbit propagation, for neural ODE fix (see `notebooks` folder)

## Installation

First, clone the repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/esa/thermonets
```

Then enter the repository and activate the conda environment:

```console
cd thermonets
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then, the module should be ready to import...

```Python
import thermonets as tn
```

## Getting Started

### thermoNET: thermospheric density computation



### Generate a Database
This repository open-sources two pre-trained thermoNET (one on the [NRLMSISE-00](https://pypi.org/project/nrlmsise00/) empirical model, and one on [JB-08](https://github.com/lcx366/ATMOS/tree/master)). In order to train a thermoNET from scratch for these two models, you can follow the tutorials under `notebooks/nrlmsise00_train.ipynb` and `noteboooks/jb08_train.ipynb`. However, it is essential to first generate a database of points to train on. This can be done by doing for NRLMSISE-00:

```console
cd scripts
python generate_nrlmsise00_db.py --n_lonlat_points 100 --min_height 180 --max_height 1000 --num_processes 1 --n_height_points 100
```

and for JB-08:
```console
cd scripts
python generate_jb08_db.py --n_lonlat_points 100 --min_height 180 --max_height 1000 --num_processes 1 --n_height_points 100
```
where `min_height`, `max_height` are in km. This might take several minutes for many points (e.g. the above is for several million points).. if you want something faster, you can reduce either the `n_lonlat_points` or `n_height_points` points requested.
